## Visualisation tool for checking the spelling in different version of English
English is not my first language, but I have studied it since childhood. During my elementary and middle school years, I learned British English. Later, when I moved to the United States to pursue my education, I had to re-learn how to spell words using the American standard. To showcase my familiarity with React and TypeScript, I decided to create a simple webpage where users can check the different spellings of words in various English variants.
